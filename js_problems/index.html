<p>Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide.[2] It includes over 500 problems,[3] with a new one added every weekend (except during the summer). Problems are of varying difficulty but each is solvable in less than a minute using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer. Problems can be sorted on difficulty. A forum specific to each question may be viewed after the user has correctly answered the given question.[4] As of June 2015 Project Euler has about 500,000 users from all over the world .</p>
<p>Participants can track their progress through achievement levels based on the number of problems solved. A new level is reached for every 25 problems solved. Special awards exist for solving special combinations of problems, for instance there is an award for solving fifty prime numbered problems. A special Eulerians level exists to track achievement based on the fastest fifty solvers of recent problems so that newer members can compete without solving older problems.[6]</p>
